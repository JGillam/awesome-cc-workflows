We are at a good stopping point for this session. Perform the following tidy-up:

1. Ensure .CLAUDE_LAST_SESSION.md is in .gitignore (check and add if missing)
2. Update any appropriate status documentation that exists for this project. If we don't have a dedicated file, then you can update @CLAUDE.md, if that's appropriate.
3. Commit our code
4. If a session summary file (.CLAUDE_LAST_SESSION.md) exists already, then remove it.
5. Create a new session summary in .CLAUDE_LAST_SESSION.md (in the project root) with the following sections:

   * Session Summary header with today's date
   * What was accomplished (features added, bugs fixed, refactoring done, files changed)
   * Current state (what's working, what's incomplete or in-progress, known issues)
   * Next steps (prioritized actions for the next session)
   * Open questions/decisions (unresolved technical decisions, blockers, questions needing user input)

5. Let the user know the session summary has been saved and they can use /tidydown in their next session to load this context
